This is a simple app to test my skills.

I'm using

* [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com), (so all I did by myself is in assets/www)

* [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) and [jQuery Mobile](http://www.jquerymobile.com)<a href=""></a>

* [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) with [localStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage) for clean JavaScript code

* Additional plugins used are [Hammer.js](https://github.com/eightmedia/hammer.js), jjoe64s [Holo Theme](https://github.com/jjoe64/jquery-mobile-android-themes)
	
* The referenced "localhost"-database is a [couchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) instance
